Test 5
Category        : 4.i to 4.iv
Input Sequence  : 'r', 'p'
Expected Outcome: two seconds after game is started asteroids fall from the top of the screen. 3 asteroids spawn at random horizontal positions 
        above the top of the screen and move smoothly into view. Asteroids do not leave the left, right or bottom edges of screen.
Status          : Passed

Test 6
Category        : 4.v to 4.x
Input Sequence  : 'r', 'p', wait until asteroids are near shield, set velocity to 0 using right wheel, shoot 1 asteroid, 's', shoot 1 boulder, 's', shoot 1 fragment, 
        increase velocity with right wheel, wait for objects to hit shield, 's', wait for new wave of asteroids to come into view, 'p'
Expected Outcome: When hit with a plasma bolt, asteroids split to form 2 boulders and boulders split to form 2 fragments and fragments disappear when hit.
        When object splits, both child objects fall straight down. Game status is sent to computer with data to show that objects have given points when shot
        (1 point for asteroids, 2 for boulders, 4 for fragments). After objects hit shield, they disappear and lives are reduced (seen in game status). 
        After all asteroids, boulders and gragments disappear, a new wave of 3 asteroids appears and scrolls into view.

        on teensy screen. The information displayed on the teensy screen is the game time, lives and score. The information sent to the computer is the game time, lives, score,
        number of asteroids, number of boulders, number of fragments, number of plasma bolts, turret aim and game velocity.
Status          : Passed

Test 8
Category        : 7.

        use left wheel to aim and 'w' to shoot at asteroids at an angle so that plasma enters the 7x7 bounding box without a pixel level collision. 
Expected Outcome: plasma enters and exits the 7x7 bounding box without causing a collision unless pixel level collision occurs.
Status          : Passed

Test 9
Category        : 8.i to 8.viii
Input Sequence  : 'r', 'p', move left and right with joystick left and right, move left and right with 'a' and 'd', use controls to move to either side of the screen
Expected Outcome: moving the joystick left or pressing 'a' increases the starfighters velocity in the left direction. moving the joystick right or pressing 'd' increases
        the starfighters velocity in the right direction. when the starfighter reaches the edge of the screen, it stops moving. 
Status          : Passed

Test 10
Category        : 9.i to 9.iv

         'o', '512', press enter
Expected Outcome: first game status will display that turret angle is -60, second game status will display that turret angle is 60, setting angle to 512 will make turret aim upwards for 1 second
        before reverting to the reading from the left wheel.
Status          : Passed

Test 11
Category        : 10.i to 10.v
Input Sequence  : 'r', 'p', joystick up for 2 seconds, 'w' for 2 seconds, shoot asteroid, shoot upwards until maximum number of plasma is reached 
Expected Outcome: joystick up or 'w' will fire plasma bolts in the direction the cannon is aimed at a rate of 1 every 0.2 seconds. bolts disappear when they hit an asteroid or when they reach the edge 
        of the screen. 20 bolts will appear on screen while firing upwards and nothing happens when firing after this number is reached.
Status          : Passed
